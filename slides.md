<!--
As an Orc horde invades the planet Azeroth using a magic portal, a few human heroes and dissenting Orcs must attempt to stop the true evil behind this war.

### Highly Entertaining Fantasy Film

When the world of the Orcs Draenor is being destroyed by the evil fel magic that uses life-force, the powerful warlock Gul&apos;dan creates a portal to the world of Azeroth and forms the Horde with members of the Orc clans. He also captures many prisoners to keep the portal. The king of Azeroth Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper) and his brother-in-law Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel) are informed by the apprentice of magician Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer) that he has found fel magic in dead bodies and the king decides to summon the Guardian of Tirisfal Medivh (Ben Foster) to protect his kingdom. Lothar and Khadgar head Kharazhan to meet Medivh and a shadow points a book to Khagdar and he takes it and hides. Anduin, Khadgar and Medivh and a group of soldiers are attacked by Orcs and they capture the slave Garona (Paula Patton), who is released by King Llane, and she shows the location of the portal. Garona is contacted by the Orc chief of a clan Durotan that wants to meet King Llane to stop the fel magic. Meanwhile Khadgar learns that the gate was opened with the help of someone in Azeroth. Shall King Lllane trust on Garona and Durotan? Whi might be the traitor?

&quot;Warcraft&quot; is a highly entertaining fantasy film with an abrupt beginning without development of the situation and characters. Most of the characters are unpleasant and non-charismatic. Maybe the fans of the video game have a big picture of Draenor and Azeroth. But the special effects are top-notch and the story is not bad. My vote is seven.

Title (Brazil): &quot;Warcraft: O Primeiro Encontro de Dois Mundos&quot; (&quot;Warcraft: The First Encounter of Two Worlds&quot;)

A new awkward park ranger arrives in a small town, and murder and havoc soon follows. The paranoid townsfolk soon suspect each other, but a devious, shapeshifting werewolf becomes their prime suspect. But who is it?

### Not enough...

It felt at times i was about to see something amazing happen but never happens. I was left disappointed with wanting more. The movie is well done and the cast is solid but it&apos;s just ok funny, never really crosses over the line to being really funny. It&apos;s worth a watch but not going to be a movie you watch again.

<!--
Ralph is tired of playing the role of a bad guy and embarks on a journey to become a video game hero. But he accidentally lets loose a deadly enemy that threatens the entire arcade.

### Virtual Joys

Wreck-It Ralph imagines a world where arcade game characters have their own lives. It&apos;s like a video game version of Toy Story and Who Framed Roger Rabbit, but this one is much more appealing to the viewers. As expected, it has an endless amount of enjoyment, a big scale of adventure, and really fun characters. The filmmakers poured their love of these games to the film thus made this a wonderful nostalgic delight.

The story doesn&apos;t sound quite fresh at some point, especially for an animated film, but the main attraction here is the theme. It sets in a magnificent arcade world. It&apos;s fun when it captures the prominent video game mannerism like the freezy movements in retro games, an out of control game character walking against the wall in 3D games, and the glitching. It&apos;s easy to know what the central games are inspired from. Many would root for the cameos of iconic game characters and each of their appearance are splendid. The movie is filled with action set pieces that are undeniably exciting. By its grand scale and references, the experience is gloriously extraordinary.

Another charms of the film is the characters. We don&apos;t usually see films with well developed characters in blockbusters these days but this one has plenty of it. They all have their own pathos, but in a comical way. And the voice performances were great. John C. Reily gives Ralph an acceptably nice personality. Sarah Silverman makes Vanellope adorable enough. Jack McBrayer is quite charming as the always positive Fix-It Felix Jr. and Alan Tudyk is delightful as the goofy King Candy.

The animation is wonderful. Like what I said, they really capture the elements of every video game. The game &quot;Sugar Rush&quot; has the most colorful(and product placed) visuals of the film. The rest is thoroughly inspired. 3D is usually unnecessary but here is just fine. It&apos;s kind of worth it by its large adventures. There is no scene after the credits but it&apos;s better to stay during it to listen to the theme songs of &quot;Sugar Rush&quot; and &quot;Fix-It Felix Jr.&quot;.

There isn&apos;t much groundbreaking about Wreck-It Ralph but what makes this special is its tribute to the classic video games. It also serves an over the top fun and sweetness(no Sugar Rush pun intended). It&apos;s so fun, it&apos;s easy to ignore its little flaws. There are some things that could have been better, but the film is already good enough. To those who love playing video-games will enjoy this a lot more. It&apos;s just full of life and nostalgia. Wreck-It Ralph is a great virtual ride!

Taking refuge on Earth, when Sonic uses his incredible speed and accidentally knock out the power in part of the United States, he catches the attention of Dr. Robotnik and must stop him from using his unique power for world domin...

### Plenty of fun.

I wasn&apos;t expecting to enjoy this, but I did, it literally was a burst of fun and energy, just like the game itself.

I would imagine there were many that would have wanted to make a movie when Sonic really was big news, but perhaps the technology at the time wasn&apos;t sufficient, now though such resources are available, it looks great.

Standout for me was Dr Robotnik, Jim Carrey looks awesome, and as always delivers with such charisma.

It won&apos;t win awards, but enjoyed it, it was genuine good fun. 7/10

*Wishes for those days of Sonic on Megadrive.

A young man must defeat his new girlfriend&apos;s seven evil exes, who are willing to do anything to prevent her happiness with someone else.

### Most enjoyable film I&apos;ve seen (so far) this year!

I heard many good things about this movie before I went to see it. Even so, I didn&apos;t go in with too many expectations I wasn&apos;t disappointed. This was probably the most enjoyable movie I&apos;ve seen so far this year. I walked out of the cinema with a smile on my face and there was even a spring in my step as I went over the preceding 112 minutes in my mind.

Scott Pilgrim is a 22 year-old living in Toronto, Canada with his gay flatmate, Wallace Wells. Scott plays bass in a band called Sex Bob-Omb which consists of Scott (of course), Kim Pine on drums, Stephen Stills on lead vocals and guitar and Young Neil as hanger-on. The band has ambitions to be famous and so have a gig coming up at a Battle of the Bands show. At the start of the film he is dating a seventeen year old schoolgirl called Knives Chau. Things seem to be going along quite well until Scott has a vision of a girl called Ramona Flowers. He becomes besotted by her and they end up hanging out together and eventually dating. Unfortunately Scott soon learns that if he wants to date Ramona he must first defeat her seven evil exe&apos;s! Can Scott defeat these evil exe&apos;s and win Ramona? What will Knives think of his infidelity? All these questions and many more remain to be answered until you&apos;ve seen the film of course.

As I said at the beginning, this was probably the most enjoyable film I&apos;ve watched so far this year. I found the quirky mix of live action with comic book elements quite refreshing and it gave the film an interesting look and feel that I liked a lot! Great performances all round, especially from Michael Cera as Scott Pilgrim, Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Ramona Flowers, Kieran Culkin as Wallace Wells, Mark Webber as Stephen Stills, Alison Pill as Kim Pine and Ellen Wong as Knives Chau.

This will most certainly feature in my best of the year awards in December. It did start to lose me a bit towards the end, but I won&apos;t hold that against it. A really well made film which deserves the praise it has got (IMO). Well worth the entrance fee and very highly recommended.

My score: 8.3/10

<!--
A young man finds a back door into a military central computer in which reality is confused with game-playing, possibly starting World War III.

### Let&apos;s play Global Thermonuclear War

WarGames is a film which in some ways seems hopelessly dated and in other ways seems to have been way ahead of its time. There&apos;s the Cold War angle, the United States and the Soviet Union gearing up for the seemingly inevitable World War III and the nuclear holocaust that would go along with it. It&apos;s a 1980s storyline which doesn&apos;t play as well all these years later with the Soviet Union long having been consigned to the dustbin of history. Nowadays the threat comes not from one communist superpower but from...well, pretty much anywhere it seems. But then again this movie, made in 1983, is at its heart really about a computer hacker. Who, in 1983, even knew there was such a thing as a computer hacker? Ahead of its time this movie is.

While certain aspects of the story may seem less relevant today there is no denying that WarGames is an effective, entertaining thriller. There may be some flaws in the movie&apos;s logic now and again, not everything we see seems entirely plausible. But the movie works. The story centers around Seattle high school student David Lightman, who is not doing particularly well in school. But it&apos;s not because he isn&apos;t bright, he certainly is. He just seems unmotivated and perhaps distracted by his obsession with computers. That obsession plays itself out as he attempts to hack into a video game manufacturer&apos;s computer...and instead unknowingly hacks into a Defense Department computer. In playing the &quot;games&quot; on that computer he almost starts World War III. Whoops.

Matthew Broderick plays David and his performance is excellent as he portrays a young teen who finds himself caught up in a situation beyond his imagination. Ally Sheedy plays his friend Jennifer, a character who seems a tad bit underdeveloped. It often seems that Jennifer&apos;s just along for the ride rather than having any real purpose in the plot. But Sheedy does well with what she has to work with. Our young hero and heroine are very much the focus of the story, at times to detrimental effect. All the adults in the story seem rather one-dimensional. Some of them have very important roles to play in the story yet we never know much of anything about them. Besides David and Jennifer there&apos;s really only one other character for whom there is any kind of character development going on and that character doesn&apos;t even show up until rather late in the proceedings. But this is a movie which will definitely hold your attention. It&apos;s a tense, taut thriller which also has some heart to it. And it often looks spectacular, most notably in the scenes which take place inside the NORAD war room, a movie set which was stunningly impressive for its time and actually would still be stunningly impressive today. All in all WarGames is a well-made, suspenseful, enjoyable film. It has its flaws but it is still a film well worth seeing.

In a world where people collect Pokémon to do battle, a boy comes across an intelligent talking Pikachu who seeks to be a detective.

### A good adaptation!

This movie is humorous and the visual effects are incredible. Even though some aspects of the movie leave us underwhelmed, it is still a step in the right direction.

A charming thief and a band of unlikely adventurers embark on an epic quest to retrieve a lost relic, but things go dangerously awry when they run afoul of the wrong people.

### Excellent D&amp;D Adaptation

Saw the sneak preview today with my wife. I&apos;m a 43-year veteran player and DM, and she&apos;s never played. She laughed through the whole thing and was riveted by the action sequences, indicating that this is an excellent intro to the world of D&amp;D for the inexperienced. I was enchanted by what they got right: the iconic monsters, the banter, the feeling of an organic adventuring party coming together combining their strengths.

Best of all, having lived in Neverwinter since 6/7/13 and the MMO&apos;s open beta, I got to see the Jewel of the Sword Coast North in all its glory.

I&apos;ll be bringing my 4H D&amp;D club to see it as soon as possible, and we&apos;ll definitely be seeing it again on our own.

Brooklyn plumbers Mario and Luigi are warped to the magical Mushroom Kingdom, and Mario must team up with Princess Peach, Toad, and Donkey Kong to save Luigi from the evil Bowser.

### The Message Of Love Is Sent Directly To The Fanbase, Not To The General Audience.

This is a movie that feels like a love letter to all the Nintendo fans out there, even if they don&apos;t necessarily play Mario anymore. The film delivers a fun and enjoyable experience for viewers by faithfully adapting every aspect of the game into the movie, including the Mario Kart and Donkey Kong franchises. The movie is packed with non-stop action and fast-paced storytelling, leaving little room for some of the more significant elements that fans might have wanted to see. It may not be able to fulfill every fan&apos;s wishes, but it&apos;s understandable and sets up for a sequel, as there is a post-credits scene.

But for general audiences who are not familiar with Mario enough, this might be a movie that is difficult to understand. There may be questions like why does it have to be like this? Why do it this way? Why is the world so strange? This is because the story hardly explains in detail for us to know how the world is. Even though the story is simple and has nothing much. But if you don&apos;t think too much, it&apos;s an easy and enjoyable movie to watch, with the lovable characters in the style of the works from the studio that made Despicable Me.

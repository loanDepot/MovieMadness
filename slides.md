### Don&apos;t think about the story too much or holes will begin to appear

Source Code is a fun movie - think Quantum Leap meets Groundhog Day. However, don&apos;t think about the story too much or holes will begin to appear. The best thing you can do is turn off your brain, appreciate the solid performances by Jake Gyllenhaal and Vera Farmiga and enjoy the ride.

At the age of 21, Tim discovers he can travel in time and change what happens and has happened in his own life. His decision to make his world a better place by getting a girlfriend turns out not to be as easy as you might think.

### Charming.

Really surprised by this one;was expecting the run of the mill rom-com, but it is so much more than that; it&apos;s about family and the smiles and cries of life. The whole film was filled with charm, wit and had its fair share of heartfelt moments. Time travel is a subject that has been visited many times in the film industry, but this had its own unique touch to it.

The film flows really nicely, it oozes class at some points. And the mere thought of having the ability to travel back in time sends your mind into a whirlwind of what-ifs? The acting is superb by all, but Bill Nighy was my favourite as Tim&apos;s Dad. When on screen with Domhnall Gleeson (Tim), the connection is very convincing and it was those scenes that i enjoyed the most.

A very good film and worthy of a viewing by any standards

7.25/10

After the devastating events of Avengers: Infinity War (2018), the universe is in ruins. With the help of remaining allies, the Avengers assemble once more in order to reverse Thanos&apos; actions and restore balance to the universe.

### They had no right to do that

First review from me. This film deserves it. A superhero film, marvel or not, does not have the right to send me on the emotional rollercoaster that End Game did. It has no right to do what it did, paying tribute to 10 years of films whilst changing the rules as to what a superhero film should be.

I laughed, lots. I cried, lots. I cheered (quietly and internally of course), lots I even punched the air in a &quot;go on!&quot; during one scene

I can honestly say, no film has ever moved me like that. Hours later, my heart was still pounding, the adrenaline still flowing from this epic piece of film making.

Made by fans, for fans. Are there flaws? Yes. If you over think the story of course there is. But it works. It flows. It fits.

Go with it. Enjoy the ride.

Soak up every second, it doesn&apos;t feel like 3 hours, it feels like a flow of story reaching a conclusion that will shock and move you.

I have nothing else to say.

10/10. Well done Russo brothers. Well done!

Fans! Assemble!

The brash James T. Kirk tries to live up to his father&apos;s legacy with Mr. Spock keeping him in check as a vengeful Romulan from the future creates black holes to destroy the Federation one planet at a time.

### Blockbusterised

I haven&apos;t seen the original Star Trek but it has a reputation for being heavy on the technobabble and continuity lockout. This film is an attempt to remake it closer to a traditional Hollywood blockbuster and it works. It is easy to follow and full of exciting action, though I can&apos;t compare it with the original.

### My number one favorite movie

Inception is my number one favorite movie off my twelve years on earth! It&apos;s absolutely impossible to explain the incredible that Inception has. Inception is Sooooooooo dang exciting, edge of seat, mind blower, and I wish there were more movies like it and more Christopher Nolans out there. Congratulations to the well deserved best director, writer, and producer of films (in my opinion). Also the acting is fabulous, everyone did an amazing job, and Leonardo was fabulous at explaining the dream concept. Also the CGI and effects are amazing. Go watch Inception because it is incredibly amazing in every aspect, and is my number one film of my twelve years on earth. Bravo to the Inception crew and wow at this fabulous movie!

### Honest review of all 3 versions

It&apos;s true that you can have too much of a good thing...please no more different editions!

THEATRICAL CUT - was the best version of any of the &quot;cuts&quot; it was the most cleanly edited and it had the best soundtrack out of the three. It is clear after seeing all the versions of the film that they tested all of the jokes and the ones included were cherry picked, and the best were picked to be included in this one.

SUPER DUPER CUT/EXTENDED - this was supposed to be an extended version of the film but it was actually a different cut...what I mean by that is that they changed the soundtrack and they cut out what I considered to be some of the funniest jokes from the theatrical cut and replaced them. They ALSO added some additional footage to the film after making those changes. This version of the film feels darker and less funny to me personally so I prefer the theatrical cut over it.

ONCE UPON A DEADPOOL/PG13 - This is the edition that nobody asked for and is the most unnecessary. From an editing standpoint this version of film is very sloppy, and seems like one giant montage. They don&apos;t even start this version of the film out at the beginning it jumps right into the &quot;safe room scene&quot;. A lot of the footage included in this edition was already available on the home releases and online (apart from the short amount filmed with Fred Savage). The movie would end up edited on TV regardless of this edition existing or not. So in reality there was no need for this edition to exist apart from making more money.

<!--
In 2074, when the mob wants to get rid of someone, the target is sent into the past, where a hired gun awaits - someone like Joe - who one day learns the mob wants to &apos;close the loop&apos; by sending back Joe&apos;s future self for assassin...

### This time travel crap; just fries your brain like an egg¬Ö&quot;

Time travel films open up all manner of questions because of the paradoxes every action and reaction produce. If X occurred, surely Y would happen, which means X wouldn&apos;t happen after all¬Ö And so it is with Looper.

Alas, to avoid dishing out hugely unpopular plot spoilers I need to skirt around the concerns, so you&apos;ll just have to come round with cake and we can discuss it in private. But there are some pretty substantial issues with Looper that cause questions to be asked and lead to more than a couple of possible explanations as to what exactly is going on. Don&apos;t see it alone; you&apos;ll need a friend around to discuss it on the journey home.

Equally, don&apos;t be put off. You don&apos;t need to be Einstein to enjoy Looper, as some of the audience proved¬Ö

In 2072, time travel is both possible and illegal and murder is more easily solved because corpses are harder to lose. However mobs and Mafiosi types are prevalent and have ingeniously devised a solution: tie your victim up and send him back in time to a location where a looper will be waiting to blow his/her brains out. However, when a looper&apos;s contract is up, they find themselves blowing the brains out of their older self. Except when looper Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) stares down the barrel at a version of himself that is thirty years older, Old Joe (Bruce Willis) outsmarts him and so begins a cat and mouse chase where there are multiples of each species and most of them aren&apos;t called Joe.

Confused? Good. Don&apos;t think any more or you&apos;ll confound yourself with your wondering and wandering along all the possible flows and tributaries that lead from them. Like, Is he actually... Dammit.

Along with the quirks, possibilities and matters left to interpretation, there are one or two clear boo-boos that cut against the rules writer/director Rian Johnson (Brick, The Brothers Bloom) has set himself. I&apos;m sure you can work out from the subject matter that there are occasional murders so I&apos;m giving nothing away by stating that a particular murder in 2027 cuts against the rules. It&apos;s not a major problem in terms of enjoyment but it does cast a shadow over everything if minor errors are not avoided.

There&apos;s only one way to watch Looper: suspend all disbelief, put your logic in stasis and get on with enjoying the romp. With that frame of mind employed, it&apos;s a superb film. No, it&apos;s not as intelligent a film as Inception, but it kicks the ass of Wanted and Gordon-Levitt is potentially a bigger star in the making than either Leonardo DiCaprio or James McAvoy.

I&apos;m not sure that I buy Gordon-Levitt as a young Willis but the transition is simple and effectively executed and it needn&apos;t stand in the way of a couple of hours of great entertainment. He&apos;s matured as an actor and, though he&apos;s been stamping around Hollywood for a good couple of decades, it&apos;s the last five years or so that have really seen him ascend the ranks and there&apos;s no sign of his climb slowing with both Spielberg&apos;s Lincoln and Don Jon&apos;s Addiction (which he also wrote and directed) in the can and Premium Rush earning plaudits on both sides of the Atlantic.

As for Willis, it&apos;s good to see him earning his fee again in a film worthy of his presence rather than phoning it in for a fat wad in the truly awful The Expendables 2. Emily Blunt (Sara) and Jeff Daniels ably provide support, the former, sadly, barely stretched and the latter, as Abe, the loopers&apos; boss, clearly enjoying himself. Equally, Paul Dano gives a wonderful, trademark sniveling wretch performance that is all too brief. But Looper belongs to Gordon-Levitt and One Tree Hill&apos;s Pierce Gagnon as the child, Cid, whose middle name is probably Damian. Unnerving is an understatement!

There is a very strong argument that the best person to direct a film is the writer because s/he knows it better than anyone. Clearly that wasn&apos;t the case with Maximum Overdrive (Stephen King being the fine writer who should never be allowed either in front of or behind a camera again) but with Looper it&apos;s a very strong case in point.

Johnson, though he bends his rules, has created a multi-layered, rapidly paced trip that is littered with bodies and to-die-for quips, to wit, &quot;I cleaned you up. And put a gun in your hand.&quot; He juggles the time zones effortlessly and maintains the excitement while allowing sufficient moments for us to pause, cogitate and catch up before whipping us to the next sprint, jump or shoot-out. Though he has nothing (publicly) on the slate, there&apos;ll be plenty more from him in the next few years.

As is increasingly the case, my biggest complaint with last night&apos;s viewing has nothing to do with the film itself but with the screening, namely the blown speakers all along one side of the auditorium (big thumbs down to Cineworld) and the moron in front who played with his phone and gave muted shrieks of excitement every time there was a shot or splatter of blood, even taking the time to relive it with his friend. Who are these people? Why are they allowed to breathe? When will time travel come to my aid? Ah, but these are niggles and hopefully you won&apos;t be subjected to such when you watch Looper. And do see it. Maybe you&apos;ll absolutely hate the confusion it causes you, but if you don&apos;t mind giving a film some real thought and you enjoyed the possibilities of Inception, then Looper is for you.

Just don&apos;t think too hard. As Abe laments, &quot;This time travel crap; just fries your brain like an egg¬Ö&quot;

While on a journey of physical and spiritual healing, a brilliant neurosurgeon is drawn into the world of the mystic arts.

### Wonderful and Amazing Escapist Entertainment

Way back when I first heard that Doctor Strange was being brought to the screen I was a bit worried. How could they translate the complexity of character and his true coolness but stay away from the cheeseball stuff? Dress a guy up like the books and remain true to the seriousness of the character? Well, they managed to not only pull it off but deliver one of the best hero origin films ever made.

The director knew that you had to establish and truly care about the character. Making it grounded but still trippy really helps give it a flavor unlike any other comic adaptation. The Harry Potter meets Iron Man meets Ant-Man flavor was there yet it all feels unique. The MCU magic is there literally. Everything established in the Captain America films and both Avengers pays dividends in a way here. The universe has been established wonderfully and this film does the best job to date playing in that universe. Everything and every scene packs some sort of punch and resonates with true style and heart. They really let the action flow but also allow for key development of the overall story and over concept. This also allows them to probe deeper into the character&apos;s personalities. ALL the characters even the ones with smaller roles get to shine. This heightens the tension, so often missing from lesser comic-book movies, and adds real weight to the action sequences which are thrilling and often mesmerizing. Add more than a dash of thriller aspects and a few new characters that steal every scene that they appear in.

I honestly can&apos;t think of one way to improve this film. The result is a movie that&apos;s just flat out exceptional and that honestly delivers the best visuals I&apos;ve ever seen in a movie.

Three magazine employees head out on an assignment to interview a guy who placed a classified advertisement seeking a companion for time travel.

### Safety Not Guaranteed...3 out of 4 Skittles

LOGLINE: Mark Duplass (Puffy Chair &amp; Humpday) plays Kenneth, the local small town weirdo who bags groceries and places a classified ad seeking a companion for time travel. Aubrey Plaza (Parks and Recreation &amp; Funny People) plays Darius, an intern sent in on assignment with her co-workers (Jake M. Johnson &amp; Karan Soni) to secretly pose as potential time travel candidates and get the scoop for the entertainment magazine.

Obviously the guy is an insane wack-job¬Öor is he? As Darius gets in closer with Kenneth and slowly finds out more and more about him, she isn&apos;t so sure anymore. Can this guy actually do what he claims, or is he so far off his rocker that he has lost all sight of reality? Writer Derek Connolly weaves in and out the possibilities of what is true and keeps the audience guessing until the film&apos;s final second payoff.

Actors Duplass and Plaza are so great radiating weirdness off of each other. The two form an unusual friendship that rings true in every detail. Jake M. Johnson (New Girl) and Karan Soni add several laughs to the bizarre¬Öyet hilarious story. The film had many chances to lose sight of believability, but finds a way to stay on course.

The film&apos;s ending left me torn. No matter if you are the kind of person rooting for Kenneth to be vindicated, or believe he is crazy all along¬Öthe story keeps you hooked until the credits roll. Safety Not Guaranteed was a breakout hit from the Sundance Film Festival, and contains the spirit of what independent films strive to be. It&apos;s authentic, creative, unusual, and a breath of fresh air. It&apos;s fun to see what independent filmmakers come up with when they aren&apos;t restrained by the annoyance of making every viewer happy. If you are up for something different¬Ödo yourself a favor and see this one.

### Not the &apos;60&apos;s &amp; &apos;70&apos;s cheesy film you may fear!

No one I know under 40 had seen this film, though we all joked about it as being a stereotypical &quot;bad&quot; film based on rumors. the title, and clips seen here and there.  Finally one weekend when I was working until 2:00 a.m. I went home and there was a sequel on late night TV, during the 30 year Planet of the Apes marathon.  It made me curious about the original and I tracked it down.  I have to say it blew me away!

The film is philosophical, creative, absorbing and scary.  Excellent commentary on religion and just about everything else. I strongly recommend to anyone who has not seen it.  So far I haven&apos;t even been able to convince my friends to see it because there seems to be such a strong prejudice against it and some sort of entrenched belief it must be bad; in fact it is one of the finest films I&apos;ve seen and I can see why it is a classic.

If you enjoy films that make you think you simply can&apos;t dislike Planet of the Apes.

### Philosophy and quantum physics mashed into a cult classic

I love everything about this film! It&apos;s been among my favorites for many years. The theories that could be well in depth for hours, the soundtrack, sweet camera shots, and the brilliant writing! I&apos;m proud of the fact that this is my 300th review on here. I&apos;d say this is my 4th favorite film ever after Fight Club, The Matrix, and True Romance. The floating wormholes is super cool to me and the soundtrack is so damn good!

Thought provoking films are my favorite ever, the fact that you could float on talking about different aspects and possibilities is beyond fascinating to me! It&apos;s extremely impressive that Richard Kelly was 26 when he wrote the script and made such a profound experience!
